    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for deep-fat frying</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>
        2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch
        thickness
      </li>
      <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the sauce, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and soy
        sauce, and a pinch of pepper to taste. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place flour and panko bread crumbs onto separate plates and season with
        salt and pepper. Place the beaten egg in a medium bowl. Dip flattened
        chicken pieces first into flour, then egg, and lastly bread crumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry breaded chicken breasts in preheated oil until golden brown and no
        longer pink in center, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined
        plate to absorb excess oil. Slice chicken into thin strips and top with
        a drizzle of sauce and a sprinkling of sliced green onions. Serve
        remaining sauce on the side for dipping.
      </li>
    </ol>
